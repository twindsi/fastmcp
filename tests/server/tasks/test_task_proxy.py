"""
Tests for MCP SEP-1686 task protocol behavior through proxy servers.

Proxy servers explicitly forbid task-augmented execution. All proxy components
(tools, prompts, resources) have task_config.mode="forbidden".

Clients connecting through proxies can:
- Execute tools/prompts/resources normally (sync execution)
- NOT use task-augmented execution (task=True fails gracefully for tools,
  raises McpError for prompts/resources)
